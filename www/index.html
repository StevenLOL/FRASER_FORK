This site provides the following material to supplement both the
book <em>Hidden Markov Models and Dynamical Systems</em>, which
is <a href="http://www.ec-securehost.com/SIAM/OT107.html">available
from SIAM</a>, and related software, which is
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/hmmds/"> available on google
code</a>:

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="software.pdf">pdf document</a> consisting of a
    version of each figure in the book and comments on how
    the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hmmds/">software</a> builds
    them
  <li><a href="doc/index.html">Documentation</a> for the software produced
    by <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a>
  <li>In the future (real soon now), I will link to a description of
    errors in the book and link to LaTeX source files for the book
    </ul>

<br>
The new code is superior to the code <em>webhmmds</em> which I
distributed here in the past. It is easier to read, use and
extend.  It's fast and has better documentation.  However the new code
does not exactly reproduce the results in the book.  The differences
are not due to errors, but are due to different code, libraries and
random number generators.  If you want to see the original code,
contact me at andy@fraserphysics.com and I will post them here.<br>
